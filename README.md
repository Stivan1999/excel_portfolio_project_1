Analysis of US Debt in excel 

1) The first thing I did in this project was to save the original data in a separate sheet. This is good practice in case I need to reference back to the original unmodified data.

2) I noticed that the data is not in a regular table format, so I copied it and paste it in a new sheet using “transpose”

3) Glancing at the data, I noticed that there are some null values in place of numerical values. To replace null values with empty cells, I typed “ctrl + H” to get to the find and replace tool

4) Looking at the numbers, they are in scientific notation. To transform them into currencies, I selected the columns and typed “ctrl + shift + 4”
